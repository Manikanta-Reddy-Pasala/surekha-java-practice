What is Collection in Java
A Collection represents a single unit of objects, i.e., a group.

What is a framework in Java
1.It provides ready-made architecture.
2.It represents a set of classes and interfaces.
3.It is optional.

What is Collection framework
The Collection framework represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. It has:
1.Interfaces and its implementations, i.e., classes
2.Algorithm

Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion,
manipulation, and deletion.

Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and
classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

Collection Interface:
The Collection interface is the interface which is implemented by all the classes in the collection framework. It declares
the methods that every collection will have. In other words, we can say that the Collection interface builds the foundation
 on which the collection framework depends.

Some methods of Collection interface are Boolean add ( Object obj), Boolean addAll ( Collection c), void clear(), etc.
which are implemented by all the subclasses of Collection interface.

List Interface:
It is the child interface of Collection interface. It inhibits a list type data structure in which we can store the ordered
collection of objects. It can have duplicate values.

List interface is implemented by the classes ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.

To instantiate the List interface, we must use :

List <data-type> list1= new ArrayList();
List <data-type> list2 = new LinkedList();
List <data-type> list3 = new Vector();
List <data-type> list4 = new Stack();
There are various methods in List interface that can be used to insert, delete, and access the elements from the list.
