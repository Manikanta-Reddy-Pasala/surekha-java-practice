    /*Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated
      problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

    Halting Condition
Just as loops can run into the problem of infinite looping, recursive functions can run into the problem of infinite
recursion. Infinite recursion is when the function never stops calling itself and gives java.lang.StackOverflowError.
Every recursive function should have a halting condition, which is the condition where the function stops calling itself.
